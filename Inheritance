3. extends keyword


Class Parent {
  public void m1() { }  
}

Class Child extends Parent {
  public void m2() { }

}

Class test{ 
p.s.v. main() {
  
  Parent p = new Parent();
  p.m1();  //Correct
  p.m2();  //Wrong, as parent doest have access to child class methods
  
  Child c = new Child();
  c.m1();  //Correct, as it has access to parent class methods
  c.m2();  // Correct 
  
  
  //Parent reference can be used to hold child class object
  Parent p = new Child();
  p.m1();  //Correct, for Parent object parent method is accessible
  p.m2();  //Incorrect, for Parent object child method is not accessible even though child class was instantiated
  
  
  //Child reference can not be used to hold parent class object
  Child c = new Parent() // Incorrect
  
}
}
