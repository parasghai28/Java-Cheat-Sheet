Inheritance
___________ 

1. is- a relationship
2. code reusability
3. extends keyword


Class Parent {
  public void m1() { }  
}

Class Child extends Parent {
  public void m2() { }

}

Class test{ 
p.s.v. main() {
  
  Parent p = new Parent();
  p.m1();  //Correct
  p.m2();  //Wrong, as parent doest have access to child class methods
  
  Child c = new Child();
  c.m1();  //Correct, as it has access to parent class methods
  c.m2();  // Correct 
  
  
  //Parent reference can be used to hold child class object
  Parent p = new Child();
  p.m1();  //Correct, for Parent object parent method is accessible
  p.m2();  //Incorrect, for Parent object child method is not accessible even though child class was instantiated
  
  
  //Child reference can not be used to hold parent class object
  Child c = new Parent() // Incorrect
  
}
}


Object is the root class in java and child classes like String, Stringbuffer, Number, Boolean, throwable extends from object class. Throwable is another
important class which is parent class of Exception and Error



Types of Inheritance
____________________

Single Inheritance- A->B
Multiple Inheritnce- not supported in java due to ambiguity problem(same method in both parent classes when inherited will create ambiguity in child class)
Multi level Inheritance- A->B->C
Hierarchal inheritance- From 1 parent class we make multiple child classes(Reverse of Multiple Inheritance)
Hynbrid Inheritance - Group of inheritance(Not supported in java)
Cyclic Inheritance- Not allowed in java. A->A, A->B & B->A
