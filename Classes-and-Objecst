Java is a Static type language which means type of variable is static. Compiler does this checking and it is called static typed checking. For exa- javascript is
not a static type checking and a one type of variable can hold another type of value. JS is a dynamically typed langugage.
Advanatages of static type checking - earlier detectin of errors

Primitive variable and Object reference
___________________________________
int id = 100 // primitve variavle
Stirng s = "paras" //  This is an object reference as String is a class and it points to a string object 
Student s = new Student() //object reference


Defualt values
____________
Instance and static variables do get a default value but local variable does't. We can not assignn values to instance and static vars at class level

class Student {
  int id = 100; // Error
  int id; // Correct
  
  void compute() {
    int num ; //Incorrect
    int num = 100; //Correct
  }
  
  main() {
  }
 
}
