Need for Collections
___________________

-Arrays are homogoenous in nature(can only accept one type of values, exception is creating an Object array)
- No Underlying data structure(have to write code for every search, sort, remove)
- Fixed in size 

Collections Framework
____________________
Collection framework includes interfaces, implementation(like arrayList), Algorithmic classes(Collections)

Some features of collection framework-
Serializable, clone(), most allow nulls, not synchronized

Legacy implementations and their recommended counterparts-
Vector -> ArrayList
Hashtable -> Hashmap
Stack -> ArrayDeque


Collection Interface- its a collection of objetcs, and polymorphically iot provides max generality so it should be used to reference an object
