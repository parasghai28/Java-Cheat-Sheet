Java is a hybrid language which uses both compiler and interpreter.
In C/C++ - we complie the source code, get and executable file and 
In Java- we use compiler to compile  the source code and get a bytecode, and then bytecode is interpreted using JVM(Interpreter)


Java Platform	Independence
__________________________

Java was introduced to solve distribited systems problem. A distributed system is where multiple programs are run on diff machines and they serve as single unit of
one big program.
Once we compile a java programa and buld a jar, we can run the jar in any OS- where JVM is installed. On compiling a java fiel the output is a class file
which contains an internl representation called bytecode. Bytecode is the instruction set of JVM and contains the .class files. Once we get bytecode we can run
it on any platform. Since executable instrcutions are different for every OS thats why we have diff JVM for every OS.

In C/C++ when compiler compiles the source code and gives us executable, it is specific to that platform only and cannot be run on other platforms



Jar vs War vs Ear
_________________
Jar - Java archive. JAR is a group of .class files
War - Web archive. WAR contains all the project files of the web application. Making a war of project helps in easy delivery,deployment of project.
Ear - Enterprise archive. Ear contains project files of enterprise application.


JDK vs JRE vs JVM
_________________
JDK - provides env for development and running of java programs. (Developer env). JDk + developement tools = JDK
JRE- Minimum req for running java programs. (Client env). JVM + library clasess = JRE 
JVM- Interpreter which runs the java programs line by line

Java vs C++
___________

Java platform independent. C++ is not.
C++ has pointers. Java no
In C++, dev has to take care of memory deallocation. No need for that in Java as it used garbage collection.
In C++, multiple inheritance is allowed. Java no.
Java and C++ both are not 100% OOP


Classloader
__________

Role of classloader- A java program is made up of a number of custom classes and core classes. When a program is executed, JVM needs to load contents of all needed
classes. JVM uses a classloader to find the classes.

Every classloader subsystem consists of 3 types of classloaders.
1.Bootstrap classloader- to load core java API classes like stringbuffer from 'bootstrap class path' (/jdk/jre/lib/rt.jar). Provided by Java env. 
2.Extension classloader- to load classess from extension classpath(/jdk/jre/lib/ext/.jar files). (Extension dirextories)- jre,ext,lib
3.Application/System classloader- to load classes from application claspath. classpath - jar,war,ear


File Structure
______________

1. Every java program can have any number of classes and the program name can be anything(given there is no public class). A java program can have atmost one
class and if it does contain one public class, java program should be named after that public class only

2. Java program can have multiple classes and each class can have its own main method. For exa a java program named test.java-

Class A { p s v main() {syso("A");} }
Class B { p s v main() {syso("B");} }
Class C { p s v main() {syso("C");} }
Class D { } 

When we  will compile this 4 .class files will be created because 4 classes are present. And if we run .A class main method for Class A will be called
But what about class D ? when we will run .D class file it will give error that main() not present.
And what if we run test.java, it will give error as well saying main not found


Import Statements
_________________

How to import a class inside our class-
1. java.util.ArrayList list = new java.util.ArrayList()
2. Or just import java.util.ArrayList(length of code is reduced and code become readable)

Types of Import- 
1. Explicit import- import java.util.ArrayList ()
2. Implicit import- import java.util.*

Implict import is almost always discouraged in real time no matter what to improve readability. 


By default some packages are available in java program
1. Java.lang - like string
2. Default-  If we Use classes present in current working directory(same location on system), we need not import it


Package
_______
1. In java program first non comment statement should be package name and then second import statement and then third class, enum, interface(Order is important)
2. Atmost one package is allowed in java program
