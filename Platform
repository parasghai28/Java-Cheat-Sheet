Java is a hybrid language which uses both compiler and interpreter.
In C/C++ - we complie the source code, get and executable file and 
In Java- we use compiler to compile  the source code and get a bytecode, and then bytecode is interpreted using JVM(Interpreter)


Java Platform	Independence
__________________________

Java was introduced to solve distribited systems problem. A distributed system is where multiple programs are run on diff machines and they serve as single unit of
one big program.
Once we compile a java programa and buld a jar, we can run the jar in any OS- where JVM is installed. On compiling a java fiel the output is a class file
which contains an internl representation called bytecode. Bytecode is the instruction set of JVM and contains the .class files. Once we get bytecode we can run
it on any platform. Since executable instrcutions are different for every OS thats why we have diff JVM for every OS.

In C/C++ when compiler compiles the source code and gives us executable, it is specific to that platform only and cannot be run on other platforms



Jar vs War vs Ear
_________________
Jar - Java archive. JAR is a group of .class files
War - Web archive. WAR contains all the project files of the web application. Making a war of project helps in easy delivery,deployment of project.
Ear - Enterprise archive. Ear contains project files of enterprise application.


JDK vs JRE vs JVM
_________________
JDK - provides env for development and running of java programs. (Developer env). JDk + developement tools = JDK
JRE- Minimum req for running java programs. (Client env). JVM + library clasess = JRE 
JVM- Interpreter which runs the java programs line by line

Java vs C++
___________

Java platform independent. C++ is not.
C++ has pointers. Java no
In C++, dev has to take care of memory deallocation. No need for that in Java as it used garbage collection.
In C++, multiple inheritance is allowed. Java no.
Java and C++ both are not 100% OOP


Classloader
