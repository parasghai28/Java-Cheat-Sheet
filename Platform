Java Platform	Independence
__________________________

Once we compile a java programa and buld a jar, we can run the jar in any OS- where JVM is installed. On compiling a java fiel the output is a class file
which contains an internl representation called bytecode. Bytecode is the instruction set of JVM. JVM converts the bytecode to executable instructions.
However executable instrcutions are different for every OS. So JVM is diffrent for every OS.



Jar vs War vs Ear
_________________
Jar - Java archive. JAR is a group of .class files
War - Web archive. WAR contains all the project files of the web application. Making a war of project helps in easy delivery,deployment of project.
Ear - Enterprise archive. Ear contains project files of enterprise application.


JDK vs JRE vs JVM
_________________
JDK - provides env for development and running of java programs. (Developer env). JDk + developement tools = JDK
JRE- Minimum req for running java programs. (Client env). JVM + library clasess = JRE 
JVM- interpreter which runs the java programs line by line
